# Plans for future features

This file outlines some possible features that could (maybe) be implemented in the future.

- [ ] iOS & Android support (if possible)
- [ ] HTTP/2.0 support
- [ ] HTTP/3.0 support (this one may be trickier than 2.0)
- [ ] Static route paths with placeholders
- [ ] Do more error throwing in AutoreleasingCache instead of silently failing or returning null.
